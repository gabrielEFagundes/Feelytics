## **Key Features**
Our platform offers a variety of different social media data, here are some examples:

- Reddit
- 4Chan
- X (Twitter)
- Instagram
- Discord
- Facebook
- Snapchat
- Tiktok
- Kwai
- Pinterest
- LINE
- WeChat

You can find not only data, but also **dashboards** that shows all the data in a more visual way.

`The data is fetched and formatted by AI, so it's easier to show them to the user.`

<br>

You can also search for specific topics on different social medias, to know what people are thinking about that topic.

We will also develop our own API for data collection, to make it easier for people to fetch data from social medias.
